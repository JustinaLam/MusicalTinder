# MusicalTinder

**Project Description:** We will implement Tinder for songs, with the main page featuring a card-swiping element that allows users to swipe right/left on songs, which fine-tunes our query to fit the userâ€™s preferences. We will also implement a search feature that allows users to request a list of songs, or information about a song, given, for example, the artist or album, from entering specific parameters (eg. artist, music region, genre, popularity, etc.)

**Backend folder:** will hold all backend logic using Node, Express, and MySQL

**Frontend folder:** will hold all frontend logic in React and JS
